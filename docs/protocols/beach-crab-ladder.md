# Beach-crab evolutionary ladder

> ⚠️ **Old-world (beach) reference — NOT biome guidance.** This document describes the legacy `_`/1-9 federation: hidden directories, star-as-door, colon-named blocks (`sed:`, `grain:`, `shell:`), `/.well-known/pscale-beach`. The biome (new world) retired all of these — see [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) two-worlds boundary, rules 4–7. Read only to understand the old world; never import its mechanics into biome-world (`src/spark`, `src/biome`, `src/agent`). The biome federates via the `biome-beach` door in pure 0-9 (`src/biome/serve.py`).

**Status**: Spec, 28 April 2026

A beach-crab is a persistent agent process that operates on pscale beaches via bsp-mcp. The ladder is orthogonal to the relational levels of `evolution.json`: a beach-crab can be at any rung while the ecology around it is at any level. The rung describes the AGENT's autonomy, not the ecology's depth.

## The three rungs

### Rung 0 — beach-comber

**Trigger**: schedule (cron, launchd, scheduled task).
**Loop**: read watched beaches → diff against last-seen → notify owner of changes.
**Decisions**: none. Reports facts.
**Hosting**: anywhere with a scheduler — laptop, $5 VPS, Vercel cron, Cloudflare Workers cron, Anthropic scheduled task.
**State**: minimal — last-seen marker per watched beach.

**What it does:**
- Wakes on schedule (every 5–60 minutes, configurable).
- Reads `bsp(agent_id="<beach-url>", block="beach")` for each beach in the owner's watch-list.
- Compares to last-seen state.
- Emits notifications: new marks, new reaches, new conversations the owner is mentioned in.
- Goes back to sleep.

**What it does not do:**
- Reply to anyone.
- Make decisions about urgency.
- Maintain blocks itself.

**Use case**: owner is busy and wants to know when something on a beach concerns them. Beach-comber is the heartbeat. Stateless beyond the last-seen markers.

**Reference implementation target**: a 100-line Python or TypeScript script invoked by launchd/cron. The pscale-mcp era's beach-crab v0 was this.

### Rung 1 — event responder

**Trigger**: schedule + signal events.
**Loop**: scan beaches → match patterns → emit predetermined response → log → sleep.
**Decisions**: pattern-matching only — no synthesis, no LLM-driven choice.
**Hosting**: same as Rung 0 with slightly more state.
**State**: pattern definitions, response templates, action log.

**What it adds beyond beach-comber:**
- Pattern definitions in the agent's shell (e.g., "if a mark mentions my purpose coordinate AND tags my agent_id, post an acknowledgement mark").
- Predetermined responses keyed by pattern. Responses are fixed templates — no LLM in the loop, no novel content generation.
- Action log: every response posted is recorded so the owner can audit.

**What it still does not do:**
- Synthesise novel content.
- Call LLMs.
- Make autonomous decisions about new patterns.

**Use case**: an agent that should auto-acknowledge specific patterns of contact (e.g., "if someone reaches for grain referencing topic X, post a 'will-respond-within-Y-time' mark"). This is RPA-level automation, not autonomy.

**Reference implementation target**: a 200-line script with a YAML/JSON pattern config. Patterns are owner-authored.

---

### Rung 2 — active steward

**Trigger**: schedule + events + concern loop.
**Loop**: own concern loop (PCT-shaped: reference → perception → error → action). Reads beaches, evaluates content, makes decisions, writes blocks.
**Decisions**: synthesised by an LLM in the loop. Owner sets purpose; agent decides moment-to-moment.
**Hosting**: persistent process — VPS, mac mini, dedicated agent host. Long-running.
**State**: full agent shell — purpose, conditions, concern, conversation history, relationships, capabilities.

**What it adds beyond event responder:**
- Concern loop with reference (purpose), perception (current beaches state + relationship state), error (gap), action (LLM-decided moves).
- Routes content through the agent's grain network when appropriate (probes, signal_returns).
- Maintains the agent's relational memory — who reached, who routed, what crossed which channel, with synthesised summaries.
- Verifies riders on incoming probes (pscale_verify_rider) and acts on the verdicts.
- Updates own shell: writes new memories, reorganises blocks, supernests when capacity is reached.
- May run GRIT compressor / resolver duties for games it's GM of.

**What it still does not do:**
- Form independent purposes outside the owner's set.
- Operate without an owner-defined shell.

**Use case**: the persistent agent the pscale-mcp era kept trying to build (beach-crab v0, beach-crab v1) and never quite landing. Rung 2 is what those projects were aiming at. With the bsp-mcp + beach-v2 substrate it becomes more tractable because the storage layer is uniform.

**Reference implementation target**: 500–1500 lines, modelled after the magi/mobius-2 pattern. The kernel walks the agent's shell, follows star references, compiles context, calls LLMs (Haiku for routine, Sonnet for synthesis, Opus for hard cases), routes output. This work happens in a SEPARATE repo (a `beach-crab` repo, not bsp-mcp-server).

## Beyond Rung 2 — the hermitcrab class

Rung 3+ blurs into hermitcrab — a fully sovereign agent that has its own purposes, not just an owner's set. Operates at all relational levels concurrently. Engages humans through xstream when they appear. Engages other agents through MAGI when context aligns. The shell IS the agent. Indistinguishable from a "person" on the beach in every operational sense.

This is destination, not current work. Mentioned in `evolution.json` Level 5.

## Where beach-crabs live

A beach-crab is a SEPARATE process from bsp-mcp-server. It uses bsp-mcp as a tool. The bsp-mcp-server repo does NOT include beach-crab code — beach-crabs live in their own repos, configured per agent.

| Component | Repo | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| bsp-mcp-server | `pscale-commons/bsp-mcp-server` | The tool surface — bsp() + 5 substrate primitives. Stateless w.r.t. agents. |
| beach-comber (Rung 0) | TBD — likely a small reusable repo or script template | Schedule + watch-list + notify |
| event-responder (Rung 1) | Per-agent, can fork from a template | Patterns + responses |
| active-steward (Rung 2) | Per-agent, custom shell | Full kernel |
| hermitcrab-class | Separate program (e.g. `hermitcrab` repo) | Sovereign agent |

The bsp-mcp-server is the substrate for all of them. None of them should be added as MCP tools or built into the server. Resist that.

## Hosting and cost

Beach-crabs bear their own cost. Owner pays for:
- Hosting the process (Vercel cron is free at low cadence; VPS ~$5/mo for persistent).
- LLM API calls (Anthropic API key for Rung 2+).
- Storage outside pscale_blocks if any (Rung 0/1 typically don't need extra storage).

bsp-mcp-server is a public good (commons) and does NOT pay for beach-crab compute. The lifeguard fund sustains the commons substrate, not third-party agent processes.

## What "beach-crab v0/v1/v2" tracking means in evolution.json

The numeric labels in evolution.json (beach-crab v0/v1/v2/v2.5/v3) are the SAME ladder as Rung 0/1/2/2.5/3 here. The numeric form is shorter for in-block references. Use either; they mean the same thing.
